Dogs & Cats Image Classifier can be used to distinguish between the images of dogs and cats.
 
Hereâ€™s a summary of steps involved:
1. Dataset Preparation:Use a dataset like the Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset, which contains thousands of labeled images of cats and dogs.
2. Preprocessing:Standardize the size of all images (e.g., 150x150 pixels). Normalization of data i.e. Scale pixel values to be between 0 and 1 by dividing by 255. Convert categorical labels (cat/dog) into numerical values (0/1).
4. Model Building:Use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification tasks due to its ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images. Build a CNN architecture or use a pre-trained model like VGG16, ResNet, or Inception with transfer learning.
5. Training: Use a binary cross-entropy loss for binary classification. Use an optimizer like Adam to minimize the loss function. Train the model on the training dataset, typically using a validation split to monitor performance and avoid overfitting.
6. Evaluation: Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the validation and test sets.
7. Prediction: Use the trained model to classify new images as either a cat or a dog. Threshold the output probabilities to get binary predictions is 0 for Cat and 1 for Dogs.
